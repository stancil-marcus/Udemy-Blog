This is a blog assignment I completed for the Udemy The Complete 2019 Web Development Bootcamp course. I completed everything in app.js and took out some code in home.ejs so it could render more efficiently with my code. I connected the program with the local mongodb database I created. Everything else was provided by the course. This project displays my knowledge of Javascript, EJS, and NodeJS, mongoDB, Body-Parser, and MongoDB.
